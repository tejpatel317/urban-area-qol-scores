# Urban Area Quality of Life Scores

Welcome to the Urban Area Quality of Life Scores web application

## Description

The Urban Area Quality of Life Scores is a web application that is used to search the quality of life scores for several urban cities. The quality of life scores that will be displayed include housing, cost of living, startups, venture capital, travel connectivity, commute, business freedom, safety, healthcare, education, environmental quality, economy, taxation, internet access, leisure & culture, and tolerance. This web application was designed to provide assistance to individuals who are deciding to move to or visit an urban city. This application will provide individuals the ability to search for urban cities, view quality of life scores for an urban city, and compare quality of life categories between urban cities from high to low, and low to high. 


## Usage

Upon entering the website, the user will see all available cities listed as cards with city images. If the user hovers the mouse over the city image, the image will be replaced with quality of life scores for that particular city. However, once the mouse is no longer over the city, the quality of life scores will disappear and the city image will reappear. To save a city and show the quality of life scores, the user can pin the city by clicking the "PIN" button. The pinned city, along with the quality of life scores will be displayed near the top of the page. The user can pin multiple cities. To search for a particular city, the user can enter the name of the urban city in the "City Name" search bar and click the "Submit" button. The page will be updated to show only cities that match the search result. Additionally, upon pinning several cities, the user can select a quality of life category from the "Score Category" drop down as well as the sort method from the "Sort By" drop down and click the "Submit" button. This will sort the particular quality of life category of the pinned cities by the sort method.
